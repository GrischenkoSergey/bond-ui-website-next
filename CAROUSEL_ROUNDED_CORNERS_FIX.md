# Section Carousel - Rounded Corners Fix

## Issue
The bottom corners of the new section carousel were sharp while the top corners were rounded.

## Root Cause
1. The `.section-carousel` had `overflow: visible !important` which allowed content to extend beyond the parent's rounded corners
2. The `.section-descriptions` container at the bottom didn't have rounded bottom corners defined

## Solution Applied

### 1. Changed `.section-carousel` overflow
**Before:**
```css
.section-carousel {
    overflow: visible !important;
}
```

**After:**
```css
.section-carousel {
    overflow: hidden !important;  /* Clip content to border-radius */
    border-radius: 10px;          /* Ensure rounded corners match carousel-mobile */
}
```

### 2. Added rounded bottom corners to `.section-descriptions`
```css
.section-descriptions {
    border-bottom-left-radius: 10px;
    border-bottom-right-radius: 10px;
}
```

## Result
✅ All four corners of the section carousel are now uniformly rounded with 10px radius
✅ Matches the styling of the main carousel at the top of the page
✅ Professional, polished appearance

## Visual Consistency
- Top corners: Rounded (10px) from `.carousel-mobile` parent
- Bottom corners: Rounded (10px) from `.section-descriptions` child
- Border radius: 10px (matches site design)
